Added includes to the project to be able to implement bullet physics for the collision and movements.
Made TutorialApplication a singleton to be able to be used in other files which means I also changed main to be able to use pointer on TutorialApplication.
Made header file for the JetController.h and made the class a singleton and created multiple functions such as createJet with bullet. Start and Update are used inside the Tutorial Application
Made the jet move with arrow keys and added boundaries so it doesnt go past the screen
