To create a top down scrolling shooter that the goal of the game is to get as much score as possible.
The game will have a fighter jet as its main controller and will have 2 seperate shooting abilities, 1 will be the bullet projectile
	that shoots forward of the jet. The other ability will be a bomb projectile that will drop at a fixed position infront of the jet.
	I will also have different types of enemies, some features of the enemy is that they might shoot straight at you, try to collide with you, or will shoot lasers.
	The ground enemies will be fixed on ground and will most likely only shoot missles at you that the jet can dodge or repel.
