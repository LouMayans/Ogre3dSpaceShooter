Added the terrain from the tutorial and lightning to the scene to make it look like there is something there
added box object to the scene that will hopefully be the start of the floor for the game.
scaled the box to make it longer and found the size of the box and changed the position to where one of the long sides was positioned at 0,0,0
Made the camera look down. added camera to container scenenode and make it move across the box at a constant speed.
