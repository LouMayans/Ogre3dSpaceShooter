Added Shooting mechanic for the jet.
Added an updateBullets function to move the bullet
Created menu screen when 'P' is pressed.
Added a pause mechanic when 'P' is pressed aswell.
made the mouse cursor properly appear and dissapear when needed.
Created a debug button on the menu to me able to move the camera around.
Added CEGUI things for the mouse movement and clicks. 
Added a pop-up console so i will be able to debug the code through it.
Added collision and rigidbody to the bullets.
created a box and made collision checks from the bullet to the box and then destroyed the bullet if it collided.
figured out how to do collision checks without BulletPhysics so I will be removing the code for it. Do not think i will need it at all for the rest of the game.
Started enemy code.
created start menu which lets you start the game with a button.
Created start sequence
made the camera stop at the end for the boss battle.
BUG:while shooting, moving the jet is ignored sometimes???????????
Made some Enemyjets and fixed their shooting.
switched the jetpos text to health text and shooting the enemies kill them and you can get hurt but not death yet.
